    <p>Drag the playing cards out of the stack and let go. Dragging them
      beyond the desk will throw them out of the stack. If you drag too
      little and let go, the cards will spring back into place. You can
      throw cards back into the stack after you have thrown them out.
      Current demo logs the direction on left and bottom only (configurable
